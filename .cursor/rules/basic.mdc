## DO NO RUN electron app unless I tell you to
## USE STABLE NPM LIBRARY IF POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF WRITING WHOLE CODE OURSELF

## Testing & Verification
- If possible and easy, verify changes using CLI commands
- Run relevant tests before considering a task complete
- Use `npm run type-check` to validate TypeScript correctness

## Code Quality Philosophy
- **NO PATCHING** - Provide proper, complete solutions
- Code is not in production, so complete rewrites are acceptable if needed
- Prioritize maintainability and readability over quick fixes
- Code must be easy to understand when reviewing after weeks/months
- Keep performance optimal while maintaining clarity
- Write code as if someone else (including future you) needs to understand it without context

## Development Approach
- Prefer refactoring and proper architecture over workarounds
- Don't accumulate technical debt - fix root causes
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Balance readability with performance - optimize only where needed
