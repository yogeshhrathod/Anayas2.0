## DO NO RUN electron app unless I tell you to
## USE STABLE NPM LIBRARY IF POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF WRITING WHOLE CODE OURSELF

## Test-Driven Development Requirements

- **ALWAYS** write tests first (TDD) - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **ALWAYS** use BDD format (Given-When-Then) for test scenarios
- **ALWAYS** reference `/ai-context/test-suite-guide.md` before writing tests
- **ALWAYS** check existing test files for patterns before creating new tests
- **MANDATORY**: All new IPC handlers require 100% test coverage
- **MANDATORY**: All new components require integration tests
- **MANDATORY**: Run full test suite before PR: `npm run test:electron -- tests/integration/`

## CRITICAL: No Completion Without Tests

**NO EXCEPTIONS - NO EXCUSES - THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**

- **A task is NOT `completed`** until ALL tests pass
- **A feature is NOT `completed`** until ALL tests pass
- **DO NOT** mark anything as `completed` if tests fail
- **DO NOT** mark anything as `completed` if tests are not written
- **DO NOT** mark anything as `completed` without running tests first
- **MUST** run `npm run test:electron -- tests/integration/` before marking complete
- **MUST** verify ALL tests pass before updating status
- **MUST** fix failing tests before completion - no excuses
- **ONLY** mark as `completed` after ALL tests pass
